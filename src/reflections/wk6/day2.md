# Day-2 | W-6 Vue/Props

### Daily Project: https://github.com/LoganPonder/nasa

## What are props?
Props are similar to arguments and functions. We can pass props through different components in Vue in order to access and use that specific value.

## What are props used for?
Props are used to pass values throughout different components within an app. Because they are 'v-bind:', they can be updated/rendered as the state of an app changes.

## Where can props be used or accessed?
Props are passed down through a parent child relationship. I parent can allow it's data/props to be sent down throughout other components, but the inverse does not apply. Dependent on what exists on the props object, the data type, and whether or not is required; the component that has the props can access them throughout that piece of code.

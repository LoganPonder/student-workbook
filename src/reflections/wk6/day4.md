### Daily Project: https://github.com/LoganPonder/blogger

### What is a nested route?
As the name implies, a nested a route in vue is where a router has an a property within it that contains other(more specific) routes that lead to other routes. Once you hit a "main" route, you can then dig deeper into once of the nested routes.

### When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
An example for a nested route could be a ecommerce site, in which your main route might be a general department, which then gets more specific such as a article of clothing, and then possibly even deeper for a brand. Ect ect 

### Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes, parameters could be passed. Going off of the previously mentioned example... a parameter such as color, or item number or something of the sort could  be passed into a specific route retrieving more specific data.

# Day 5 | W6

## Week in Review.....

This week started off great. Coming off the previous week with node, I was excited to get started on the front end again, and learn Vue. As the week progressed I really was doing alright and enjoying learning a new technology. And to be honest, I felt like I was learning it quite well. That is until Friday came around.... I blanked. I felt as if I hadn't learned anything the entire week. While I do understand that the checkpoint is much more advanced than anything we have worked on up until this point, I feel like I should be doing much better than I am. I understand javascript, and feel confident in troubleshooting the errors I get, but I haven't been able to pinpoint why I tend to "blank" and have a mental block on the checkpoints. 

At the moment, I still have yet to finish the checkpoint, even after spending all weekend on it... which is pretty discouraging. This is the first time in the course where I've truly been stuck, with no idea how to move forward. To be quite frank, I'm a bit worried I may be falling behind... hopefully things will start to click soon.

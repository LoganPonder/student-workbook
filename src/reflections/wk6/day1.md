### What is Component based architecture?
CBA is a style in which many smaller 'components' of code are pieced together to form a larger, cohesive application.

### What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
CBA allows essentially for a modular code base. Each component operates independently from the others, which allows them to be updated seperately as each component has their own structure, methods, and APU's. An application can have many moving parts, operating apart from eachother, but forming a larger functional application.

### What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
CBA can often lead to a less readable code base, since all of the relating data/styling/code to a component is located is one place.

### Why do we use Git?

Git is a vital tool used in development. It allows multiple developers to work on not only the same project, but on different features of that project simultaneously. 

Git Version Control also provides a sort of 'saftey net' when things go wrong. If a new feature is implemented and code begins to break, with Git, a developer/team can revisit previous commits and see what went wrong instead of having to rewrite the program in its entirety.

As mentioned previously, with Git multiple 'branches' of an application can be worked on at one time. For example, each developer on a team would have his/her own local repository, pointing to one shared remote repository. Each developer can then work on their portion of the application without affecting their team-members. Without Git, a team of developers would not be able to work on the same project due to constantly changing, constantly conflicting lines of code. Due to having a single remote repository, a team can work on a single application regardless of geographical location. Open Source projects are a perfect example of this. For a more detailed explanation on Open Source projects, check out [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github).

Git's version control system is most often managed through a cloud hosting service called [GitHub](https://google.com).

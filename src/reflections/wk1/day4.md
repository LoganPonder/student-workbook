# Day 4 - WireFrames

### 1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    
Wire frames allow a designer/team of designers to create mock-ups of what a potential application might look like. Taking into account design elements, user interaction, ect. It also provides an opportunity for developers to bounce ideas and receive feedback from clients prior to the actual development of an application.

### 2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

*   Low-Fidelity wire frames: typically a quick mockup, it creates a very high level overview of the application. Not taking into account detailed aspects of design. A great wire frame choice to start generating ideas and direction, typically done on paper.

*   Mid-Fidelity wire frames: contain far more detail than low-fidelity frames. They take into account a more detailed page layout, as well as variants in color(although mostly still produced in black and white/ without images). Often created digitally.

*   High-Fidelity wire frames: the most in-depth wire frame, these take into exact layout measurements as well as specific image and color themes throughout an application. 

### 3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

 Wire frames provide a high-level overview of an application. I think there is a lot of value in creating wire frames due to the fact it requires a developer to think about how a page might look and be laid out. And also how a user might interact with each feature. This extra time spent in the beginning will create a smoother, more efficient development process.

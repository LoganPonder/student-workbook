# Day 5 - End of Week 1

Coming into the course I felt comfortable with CSS, certainly not great with it but good enough that I felt like I would be able to complete the assignments given to me. To my surprise, Boostrap kinda threw me for a loop. Not in the sense that it was a difficult framework, not at all. More in the sense that my mind is used to thinking in normal CSS, that some of the components of Boostrap and what I'm used to weren't connecting.

The First two projects I struggled with, having a sort of mental jam in trying to use BootStrap and my mind defaulting to standard CSS.

When beginning Checkpoint #1, I took a lot of time to set up the wire frame of my design and that was something that helped me immensely! I'll definitely continue to do that in my future projects. As a whole, I'm not totally satisfied with the outcome of my checkpoint project. While I think it looks alright on desktop and mobile(iphoneX), many more breakpoints are needed to account for other devices. I feel the custom CSS file is a bit stringy and could be streamlined. But I think that issues will work itself out as I learn how I can use certain Bootstrap classes and custom CSS better together.

Overall, I'm feeling confident about the next week, and getting more familiar with Bootstrap. I'm really looking forward to learning Javascript.

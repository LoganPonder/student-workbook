# Day 3 - Html/Css

What I learned today...

### 1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

One of the tips I thought was interesting was to not color every background on buttons. I've always had the notion that buttons should always have some kind of color that goes along with the theme of the page. In the future I can spend more time thinking about the visual hierarchy of the page so that I can move away from feeling the need to color every button. In addition, I think having buttons with perhaps just an outline adds a cleaner, more modern aesthetic to the page.

### 2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Below are a few resources that I refer to for tips, tricks, and design inspiration...

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

[Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

[Smashing Pumpkings: CSS Layout](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/);

[Creative Blog Design Ideas](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/examples-css-912710);


### 3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

When a client or user visits a page, the first thing that he/she will notice is the overall design/layout of the page. This not only attracts potential customers/users, but also conveys the overall brand image of the entity. In addition to this, a company that fully understands its target customer can tailor the design of their website's appearance to attract their "ideal customer" through a design/aesthetic the target customer might find most appealing.

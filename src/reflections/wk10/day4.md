## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are strongly typed constants, that give attatch names to int values.

## How can you modify an Enum?
With enums you could change the int value, otherwise it will be +1 of the value before it. You can also modify base types by attatching and enum identifier.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
You could use enums for example when working with days of the week... ie
enum Weekdays
{
    Monday = 1,
    Tuesday,
    WEdnesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday
}

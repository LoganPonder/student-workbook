## What is a List in C#?
A list is a collection of items that can be accessed by indexes that can be searched sorted ect...

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
I see a lot of similarities between JS array methods and C# List methods.... List.Contains would be helpful to see if there is an instance of a particular data set within a List. As well as List.Find in order to be able to search for a specific piece of data within a list.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
You use List.find(), to find the first occurrence that fufills a specified condition

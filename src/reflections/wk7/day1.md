# Day 1 - W7 Pair Programming

### Daily Project: Work on Kanban

## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is when two developers share one work station. One is a "driver" and types, while the other is the "navigator" and provides direction. The two swap roles often.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Better quality code can be expected, as well as a sharing of knowledge between a junior/senior developer and perhaps someone who is still learning the code base and is paired with someone who is very experienced with that particular code.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
A drawback(while not concrete) is that there is a 15% overhead that comes with paired programming.

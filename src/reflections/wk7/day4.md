# Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

### Daily Project: Work on Kanban

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
I really enjoyed pair-programming with my partner Taylor. Hearing eachother talk about code really helped my thought process.

## What went well?
We worked really well together. He is a really great at the functionality, and I'm confident enough with it that we could both check eachother and watch for mistakes. Because of that we really didn't run into any serious errors. Which is great!

## What would you do differently?
Per the description of pair-programming, we could have switched 'driver/navigator' roles more often. I wanted more practice with Backend, and spent all day driving with that. And he spent the next day doing Frontend. It worked well, but we probably should have switched more.

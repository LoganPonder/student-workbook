##  What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code documentation is essentially comments for your code that will help specify what your trying to do, for reference at a later time/or for fellow colleagues. You can add a comment before a function specifying the type of parameters you are passing in as arguments.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Code Documentation is an easy way to make mental notes about your code, what it's doing, and how to properly use it. By doing it before writing your function, it assists in really understanding the logic and what it's doing prior to writing the code block.

## How important is Code documentation and why?
Code Documentation is very important. By spending a bit of extra time Docs can very easily say future developers heaps of time when it comes to revisit that particular code block.

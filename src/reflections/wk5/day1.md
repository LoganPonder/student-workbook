### Daily Project: https://github.com/LoganPonder/burgers-server

## What is the purpose of a Query String?
A query string allows you to send/request specific data, which is appended to the end of a url.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
A query starts with a '?', each additional parameter appended to the query are seperated with a '&'.

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
When making specific CRUD requests, a strong knowledge on how to correctly format these queries would come in handy.

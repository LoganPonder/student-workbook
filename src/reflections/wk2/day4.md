### What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Taking the extra time to make a detailed plan can provide a huge advantage when writing a program. It allows a developer to think about the logic in detail, as well as how a user might interact with the program. It gives the developer a chance to think about what might go wrong, and account/write test for that specific program. 

### How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I try to think about the logic of that specific problem. Once I identify the problem and what needs to be solved, I began to rack my brain for previous problems that I might have solved that could be similar to that. and if I can piece together solutions to create one specific to that problem. I also reference MDN to better understand potential methods or concepts that are unclear. And as always, google. Seeing others code, and trying to understand their logic often times helps me solve my own problems.

### From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

A reoccurring theme I'm beginning to take away is the importance of planning. Previously, I would tend to just jump into a program and hope for the best. By thinking out the logic of a application, and trying to better understand the end result the development process goes a lot smoother. Creating a detailed wireframe and seeing the end result helps me connect the dots on logic and how a potential user might interact with my application.

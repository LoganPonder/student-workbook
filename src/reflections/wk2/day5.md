# Day 1 / W2 - Intro to JavaScript

Daily Journal....

This week was a big step from last week. To be able to actually start with JavaScript was a different kind of challenge when compared to Boostrap. In Week 1 I was able to coast through, and with Week 2 there were times I really had to think about what I was trying to do; mainly in some of the coding challenges in our afternoon projects. I really appreciate the stretch goals and the bonus challenges. They force me to really breakdown and work through the logic of a problem. In addition to learning, I've really enjoyed building something new everday, and learning how to better approach the logic with each unique problem.

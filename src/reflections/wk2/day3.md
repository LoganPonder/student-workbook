### What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should  you use each style.
Loggin things the console can be valuable tool while trying to debug your code, or understand what a value might be at any give time. Often the most popular, console.log() utlizies the area where errors are written, same as with console.error(). Console.table(), as it's name suggest can present date in a more table like format allowing for easy viewing/understanding.

### Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements Tab allows you to breakdown the HTML and CSS for a page. It allows  you to manipulate the DOM and see the immediate results in the window. In addition to being able to make immediate changes, these changes do not auot-save in the file, so it's a perfect tool to experiment a bit to see what looks best.

### Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
A better way to debug code is by using the Sources Tab. In the Sources Tab you can not only see your files, but you can manipulate them. By adding debuggers/breakpoints, a developer can pause their code and step through each line/each function, step by step, pinpointing where a potential problem might be occuring.

### What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
Rest stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is a pattern/concept for API's in which a client and server can communicated based off of certain "rules/requirments". Of which, include a URL and specific endpoints in which a client can request. If formatted correctly, the server can respond with that given resourse indicated via the specific URL provided.

### What does Stateless mean?
As it pertains to Servers, stateless means that the server will have no memory when it comes to what a client may have/have not already requested. When a client requests a specific resource, the client must include all the correctly formatted info required by the server each time. Cause the server is "stateless".

### What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
When writing to a RESTful API/server, you must provide a specific URL/endpoint for the resource you are interested in... and also you must include one of the HTTP request methods. (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, among others)

### Daily Project: https://github.com/LoganPonder/pokemon-api

### What is the purpose of Async/Await?
Async/Await bridges the gap between promises/Asynchronus code. A/A use promises for a easier to understand/visualize code.

### What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
You must include the keyword **'await'** in your code(at the begining of function body).

### What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
Async/Await is much easier to understand and reason about than promises or callbacks are. The appear to be synchronus/blocking code, but under the hood are asynchronus. It's also much easier to debug A/A, as well as chain multiple A/A together.

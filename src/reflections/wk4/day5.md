# Day-5 | W3

## Weekly Reflection: 

This week went quite well. Coming into this week I had a bit of exposure making API requests, but not with using Axios. I have to say, I really liked using it a found it to be quite simple. That's not to say that I didn't run into issues, but I felt that I could easily grasp what was going on and how to correctly format each HTTP request. While last week at times I struggled to wrap my head around the MVC design pattern, this week at times I found that it came quite naturally. Not having to think as much about how MVC works, and more on my code was a step in the right direction. 

Moving forward, outside of Javascript, I'd like to spend more time on coding challenges. I struggled a bit with Whiteboard Wednesday and feel like that should be more of a focus moving forward.

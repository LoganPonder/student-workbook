## What is Software Development Testing?
Software Development Testing, as the name implies is the process of testing pieces of code(modules) as a program is written. Taking into consideration not only the "expected" functionality, but testing for the edge cases that might appear and "break" a program.

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
By testing individual modules of code a dev team can rest assured that their program will continue to work, regardless of "machine" or user input. All of the "unexpected" things have been taken into consideration and the program is much more likely to run as intended.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Often a drawback could be the additional time that it takes to write these tests. If the code is to closely paired, a simple change in one module could send a ripple throughout the code base, requiring multiple changes to not only the code, but the tests as well.

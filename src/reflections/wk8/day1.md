### Daily Project: Continue working on checkpoint

### What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A Portfolio for a dev is essentially a business card. It's the first impression that a potential employer will have of you, and not only displays some of your previous work, but can give an Idea of your personality and your particular "brand image".

### What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
An effective dev portfolio is one that showcases your skills in a clear, easy to follow manner. If you happen to be interviewing with a specific company, you could tailor which pieces you'll showcase so that is a bit more relevant to the interviewer.

### What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
So far, I would showcase the Kanban as well as the Bug Tracker. I think they both have "real world" functionality to them. Although before adding them to my portfolio I would need to go back and polish them up a bit, making each of them more responsive.

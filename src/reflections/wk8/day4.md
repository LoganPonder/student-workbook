# Day 4 - W8 

### Daily Project: Capstone

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

* Unit Testing - individual units of code, tested in isolation
* Component Testing - tests vue components in a way were the vue tools/virutal dom can be accessed and used 
* End-To-End (E2E) Testing - test all layers of an application, front to back taking in to consideration how and what the user will experience

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I like the idea of unit testing more, I think breaking down code into smaller components and ensuring that each of these work as they are writtten would prove for a much more efficent and smoother development process.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
End to End Testing. Not only does it take more time, but the fact that it is somewhat "all of nothing", and errors might be harder to pinpoint. That being said, I certainly think it has it's time and place, like when ann app is finally completed and a "final review" is required.

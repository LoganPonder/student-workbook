# Day 3 - W9

### Daily Project: Capstone

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
The number of meetings and/or the length of the meetings could differ. With a smaller team, it's important to make sure everyone is on the same page, but at the same time the majority of the time needs to be in actualy development as there are a limited number of people/resources.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
By limiting development to 1 sprint at a time, the team can have a clear common goal to focus on... instead of multiple in which goals/tasks might become "lost" of overlooked.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
* Good service Cheap won't be Fast

* Good service Fast won't be Cheap

* Fast service Cheap won't be Good

By understanding the above, knowing what is feasible within a timeframe allows reasonable goals to be set during the scrum process.

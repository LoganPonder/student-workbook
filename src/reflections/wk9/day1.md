# Day 1 - W9 

### Daily Project: Capstone

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
Thus far we have finished our server utilizing node.js and express. We have already started to connect our server with the client and follow MVC in conjunction with Vue components.

## What went well so far?
Our team has done a really great job thinking out the business logic and all aspects of functionality. We understand how our app is going to work on both the front and back end.

## What would you do differently? Why?
Personally, I gravitate towards the UI design more so than the functionality, so I need to spend more time with that.
